# This application layer acts as the orchestrator for the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers. It contains application logic and business rules that coordinate tasks using the domain models. For example, it might include a module for processing new user registrations, where it would use domain services to verify user data and infrastructure services to store the user.
